# **Introduction**



The ontology postulates a **reduction base** by which it can  explain how an **image of the external world** is created and experienced. This **panvibrational  reduction base** explains and formulates which **psycho-physical laws** are involved (f.e.; Gibson's invariance laws, optical flow fields, etc.) that explain the generation and perception of a **holographic image** of external events and happenings in the mind. 

In this ontology of consciousness, the reduction base is called "**Panvibrational Vision on Consciousness**" and the underlying crucial psycho-physical laws were first formulated by the late psychologist James Gibson and his work on the nature and psycho-physical mechanisms of **visual perception**. The Philosophy of Mind of Henri Bergson also plays a fundamental role in this theory of Prima Experientia and the panexperiential reduction with the **ultimate metaphysical goal** of solving the "**Hard Problem of Consciousness**" (Chalmers, 1995).
