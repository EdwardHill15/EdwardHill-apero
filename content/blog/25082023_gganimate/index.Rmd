# **Unwholesome consciousness as a predictor for depression and anxiety**

## **Introduction**
This is one of the animated visualizations I created of my analyses of data in my PhD-thesis I'm working on. The objective is to write an article in which I relate Theravada Buddhist Psychology of the Abhidhamma (Buddhist Psychology/Philosophy of Consciousness) with Western scientific views on psychopathology. I've found already some interesting results. In my analyses It appears, for example, that unwholesome consciousness is a predictor for depression and anxiety as you can see in the vsiualizations I created recently.
