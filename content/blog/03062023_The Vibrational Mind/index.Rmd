**The Vibrational Mind**
<br>
<br>
‘I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High’
<br>
<br>
~ PSALM 82:6 (KJV)

**“God” consciousness**
<br>
The belief that Jesus is regarded as the exclusive Son of God is a central tenet in Christian theology. According to Christian teachings, Jesus is considered unique in His divine nature and is seen as the ultimate manifestation of God's love and redemption for humanity. This concept emphasizes Jesus' special relationship with God the Father, positioning Him as the sole Son of God, distinct from any other being. This belief is a fundamental pillar of Christian faith and shapes the understanding of Jesus' role as Mediator between God and humankind and its Savior.
<br>
<br>
I believe that this tenet is a fundamental misunderstanding of reality, which subsequently obscures the true nature of human consciousness. From my perspective, this belief places an exclusive emphasis on the divinity of Jesus as the only Son of God, which potentially limits our understanding of the dimensions of human consciousness and spirituality. By narrowing our focus solely on Jesus' unique status, we may overlook the inherent diversity and interconnectedness of human experiences and spiritual paths.
<br>
<br>
**A temporal metaphysical vision**
<br>
The temporal metaphysical vision of consciousness, a more inclusive and expansive approach to explore the nature of human consciousness, would involve considering a wider range of perspectives and philosophical frameworks. By acknowledging the richness and complexity of human spirituality, we can realize a deeper understanding of consciousness that encompasses various cultural, religious, and philosophical traditions.
<br>
<br>
In this approach, the concept of a "body" or "matter" is considered a distinct type of experience. It views all experiences as being rooted in "vibration" or "energy," which constitutes the fundamental nature and source of all phenomena. Consequently, when the physical "body" ceases to exist, it is solely the experience of the "body" that fades away. Its underlying energy persists and will subsequently manifest in a different form within the holographic field.
<br>
<br>
The notion of a tangible and separate body is understood as a transient phenomenon, while its essence —the energetic vibration—endures. This energy is believed to interact with and participate in the interconnected fabric of the holographic field, continuously transformed and manifested in various ways.
<br>
<br>
By perceiving human consciousness and the nature of reality through the lens of vibrational energy, this approach suggests a dynamic and interconnected nature of existence, wherein a body is just one expression among countless others. This viewpoint encourages the exploration of broader dimensions of consciousness and the potential for transformative experiences beyond the limitations of physicality.
