# **Introduction**

This particular ontology of mind and consciousness posits a reduction base as its explanatory framework for the creation and experience of external world images. The **reduction base**, termed "Panvibration," elucidates the psycho-physical laws, including Gibson's invariance laws and optical flow fields, that are involved in generating and perceiving holographic images of external events in the human mind.
<br>
<br>
The term **Panvibration** refers to the reduction base in this ontology of mind and consciousness. The late psychologist James Gibson's seminal work on the psycho-physical mechanisms of visual perception [@Gibson1950] informs the fundamental psycho-physical laws underlying this ontology. Additionally, the Philosophy of Mind by Henri Bergson [@Bergson1911], [@Bergson1910a], [@Bergson1922] plays a crucial role in this ontological theory, with the ultimate aim of resolving the **Hard Problem of Consciousness** [@Chalmers1995].
